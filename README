========================
*it seems our lab1A readme was lost somewhere along the way after we turned it in
with lab 1A. So here is the readme for lab 1B.

Readme for Lab 1B:

For this part of the lab, we essentially made 1 big switch statement in execute_command.
Each one of the cases would be types of commands that could be passed in. For each of the cases, it would call
the respective handler function which would handle the command.  With the exception of simple command, the command
handlers would call execute_command recursively until the commands became simple enough to be executed.

In order to execute the simple commands, the main process would be forked and execvp would be called on the
command, executing it and returning a status value which is received by the waiting parent process and stored in the
command's status.

For input and output redirection as well as piping, we employed the use of the function dup2(args), which essentially
replaced stdout and stdin so that the files which were being written to or read from could be written to or read from
respectively.
