# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We forked a new process to create a new child. Each child could run task_upload or task_download.
task_upload was the first one to run, then after all the children were spawned, we waited for all the
children to finish. After all the children finished, we forked again and each child ran task_upload.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

One thing I did to fix the buffer overrun problem was that in task_download, we made it so that every time write_from_task_buf is called, it checks the value of t->total_written.
If it is larger than a defined constant of MAX_DL_SIZE, it throws and error, stops the 
download, and checks for other peers to download from.
(the code implementing this is found in lines 613-617)

Another potential buffer overrun we fixed was if the filename requested was too large. We fixed this by using strncpy
to set a max size of the string to copy instead of strcpy. This was in start_download.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

We made it so a made it so if a malicious file hoster tries to serve us a file
that is way too big (i.e. /dev/full) our program catches it and stops downloading.
It does this by using a max file size to make sure it has not downloaded anything
more than that

We also protected against someone trying to send too many connections. We counted
how many connections were coming from a single source and limited them to a max
number of consecuative connections and denied service after that. This code is
in lines 668-682.

Lastly, we also made sure the file served was in the current working directory
and not outside of it or anywhere else. We did this by comparing the 
file path to the current working directory. This code was in lines 720-735.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

We implemented 3 different attacks for evil mode.  The first one overloads the filename 
buffer for the peer that is uploading to the evil peer.  When the evil peer requests a
file, it sends a filename which is much longer than the filename size, and therefore when
the good peer gets the message, it should fail.
(the code for implementing this attack is in lines 543-559)

The second one is just a while (1) loop which, after connecting to a peer, continually
connects and requests, so that the peer it’s connected gets hung up by it and cannot do anything else. It starts by simply entering the while loop.  In the loop, it calls open_socket on the good peer, opening a new connection with it.  Then it sends a request, forcing the good peer to deal with it.  This keeps the good peer occupied and busy so
it can’t service other peers.
(the code for implementing this attack is in lines 563-572)

The third one is an attack on a peer trying to download by opening dev/full into the 
task disk file descriptor.  This way when the peer tries to download the data from the
file it requested, it instead downloads infinitely from dev/full.  So instead of 
downloading the file requested, it continuously and indefinitely downloads random
data from dev/full.
(the code for implementing this attack is in lines 738-741)
