The code we wrote passes the given testcases and also passes deadlock cases we created for it too.
To handle deadlock and killing of processes, we needed to create two seperate linked lists to 
store in the structure osprd_info_t. In these linked lists we stored the ticket numbers of the 
processes that were killed prematurely. In the other linked list we keep track of pids to
prevent deadlock.
